# PawFosterFamily

# Abstract - The PawFosterFamily is a web-based application wherein the welfare of shelter pet animals is taken care of. It is a place to connect shelter with fosterfamily to take care of stray, lost, abandoned, or surrendered pets. The application allows the shelter to post pets that need foster and fosterfamily to volunteer fostercare towards the pets.

# Purpose — The main purpose of this project is to automate the process of serving towards the welfare of the pets by giving the abandoned pets care for them with affection and relief the pressure from shelter.

# Introduction - The fosteruser can do the foster process through the application as this process is time-consuming if done manually. The fosteruser can choose the pets that are available to foster in the shelter to view their details, and if they wish they can continue with the process of foster. The shelteruser can post the pets that need fostercare. They can then review the foster requests from fosterusers and approve or rejects after viewing the fosterusers' profiles.


# Module Description — The project is divided into different modules:  

# On the Login/Sign Up page, the users can switch between foster page or shelter page and create a new profile or log in to the dashboard using their email and password.
